The bug is that there is a defined function `nsISound.playSystemSound` inside the widget folder that is never used.
Implementations of this method also exist in `widget/gtk/nsSound.cpp` and `widget/nsSoundProxy.cpp`

The benefit of removing this will be that there is less unused code, and the behaviour of the application is less confusing.

The Solution is to remove the unused function declaration, and it's unused implementations.

## Testing

Testing will be done by running `./mach xpcshell-test` to ensure that the function is really no longer needed, and does not cause any problems.

If all the tests pass, this has been a succesful fix.
